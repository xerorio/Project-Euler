# If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.
# {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}
# For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

# strategy
# get a set of all the right angle triangles, there must be a trick
# create a dictionary for whichever ones add up to a certain
# whichever number as the most number of sums is the winner!

# most of the time
# if a is odd, then b and c differ by 1
# if a is even, then b and c differ by 2
